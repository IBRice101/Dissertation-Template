# Abertay University LaTeX Dissertation Template

This template is a basic outline of what one is expected to write in a dissertation for BSc. (Hons.) Ethical Hacking at Abertay University 

## Submission Requirements

- 10000 words (+/- 10%) excluding abstract, appendices and references, ie body of work
- 1.5 spacing and 12 point font
- Submit a copy via MLS. Turnitin will be used to verify authenticity

## General Advice

- Write in the third person:
- Please check grammar and spelling
- Read your work through to make sure it flows
- Remember, your work may be second-marked by a non-specialist in your field
- Use the Abertay Harvard referencing style – CITE THEM RITE

- Think of your dissertation as a story to be told to an interested reader (who could be considered as one of your peers in terms of subject knowledge and understanding) – in this way a number of general points can be made:
- The dissertation is not a diary and so need not follow the events in chronological order; choose an order that makes sense and is easy to follow.

- You don’t need to include everything. You may well leave out some work that took a lot of time or was very interesting simply because you can’t see how to include it in the main story (perhaps an Appendix).
- Present work in a logical order. Give the reader the information they need to understand something but give a gentle reminder if you presented it some way earlier in the dissertation.

- Don’t spend a lot of time describing or explaining something that doesn’t get used or is pretty minor. The reader is putting effort into what they are reading and doesn’t want to feel that any of that effort is wasted.
- Don’t try to explain everything to the ultimate degree. Use references to save yourself the trouble but do explain things that are key to understanding your work. Going away to track down and check a reference should not be a necessity to understand the main aspects of the dissertation.

- Relegate long pieces of explanation or extensive listings of data to an appendix; they would disrupt the reading of the dissertation if included in the main part.
- The tone of the dissertation should be professional, honest and upbeat. Don’t dwell on problems or spend a lot of time making excuses – look to report things in a positive light.
